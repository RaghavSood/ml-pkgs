# The bleeding repository

A collection of packages that do exist in [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/). However, the versions are not quite up-to-date. Packages here will gradue once I or someone else gets the newest version into the current active branch of nixpkgs.

1. Pytorch Lightning 1.9.0 - This is from Nixpkgs upstream. I have to modify it slightly just to make it compatible with 22.11.
